## Sheet 1

# Task 1 


The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.  In
a Python file, define a function called `sphere_volume()` that
accepts a single parameter $r$.  Return the volume of the sphere of
radius $r$, using $3.14159$ as an approximation for $\pi$ (for now).
Also write an appropriate docstring for your function. Try keeping
the body of the function down to a single line of code.

To test your function, call it under the `if __name__ == "__main__"`
clause and print the returned value.  Run your file to see if your
answer is what you expect it to be.
