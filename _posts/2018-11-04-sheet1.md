## Sheet 1

### Task 1 


The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.  In
a Python file, define a function called `sphere_volume()` that
accepts a single parameter $r$.  Return the volume of the sphere of
radius $r$, using $3.14159$ as an approximation for $\pi$ (for now).
Also write an appropriate docstring for your function. Try keeping
the body of the function down to a single line of code.

To test your function, call it under the `if __name__ == "__main__"`
clause and print the returned value.  Run your file to see if your
answer is what you expect it to be.


### Task 2

The built-in `print()` function has the useful keyword arguments `sep` and `end`.
It accepts any number of positional arguments and prints them out with
`sep` inserted between values (defaulting to a space), then prints `end`
(defaulting to the /newline character/ `'\n'`).
```python
>>> print(1, 2, 3, sep=', ', end='!!!\n')
1, 2, 3!!!
```

Write a function called `isolate()` that accepts five arguments.
Print the first three separated by 5 spaces, then print the rest with a single space between each output.
For example,
```python
>>> isolate(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1     2     3 4 5
```


### Task 3

Write two new functions, called `first_half()` and `backward()`.

1. `first_half()` should accept a parameter and return the first half of it, excluding the middle character if there is an odd number of characters.
(Hint: the built-in function `len()` returns the length of the input.)
2. The `backward()` function should accept a parameter and reverse the
order of its characters using slicing, then return the reversed string. (Hint: The `step` parameter used in slicing can be negative.)

Use IPython to quickly test your syntax for each function.



### Task 4

Write a function called `list_ops()`.
Define a list with the entries `"bear"`, `"ant"`, `"cat"`, and `"dog"`, in that order.
Then perform the following operations on the list:

1. Append `"eagle"`.
2. Replace the entry at index 2 with `"fox"`.
3. Remove (or pop) the entry at index 1.
4. Sort the list in reverse alphabetical order.
5. Replace `"eagle"` with `"hawk"`. (Hint: the list's `index()` method may be helpful.)
6. Add the string `"hunter"` to the last entry in the list.

Return the resulting list.

Work out (on paper) what the result should be, then check that your function returns the correct list.
Consider printing the list at each step to see the intermediate results.


### Task 5

Write a function called `pig_latin()`.
Accept a parameter `word`, translate it into Pig Latin, then return the translation.
Specifically, if `word` starts with a vowel, add "hay" to the end; if `word` starts with a consonant, take the first character of `word`, move it to the end, and add "ay".
(Hint: use the `in` operator to check if the first letter is a vowel.)



### Task 6

This problem originates from https://projecteuler.net, an excellent resource for math-related coding problems.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times 99.$
Write a function called `palindrome()` that finds and returns the
largest palindromic number made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.



### Task 6

The alternating harmonic series is defined as follows.

\\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} - \ldots = \ln(2)\\]

Write a function called `alt_harmonic()` that accepts an integer $n$.
Use a list comprehension to quickly compute the first $n$ terms of this series (be careful not to compute only $n-1$ terms).
The sum of the first 500,000 terms of this series approximates $\ln(2)$
to five decimal places. (Hint: consider using Python's built-in `sum()` function.)


### Task 7

Write a function that accepts a list $L$ and returns the minimum,
maximum, and average of the entries of $L$ (in that order).  Can you
implement this function in a single line?




### Task 8

Determine which of Python's object types are mutable and which are immutable by repeating the following experiment for an `int`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, and `set`.

1. Create an object of the given type and assign a name to it.
2. Assign a new name to the first name.
3. Alter the object via only one of the names (for tuples, use `my_tuple += (1,)`).
4. Check to see if the two names are equal.
    If they are, then since changing one name changed the other, the names refer to the same object and the object type is mutable.
    Otherwise, the names refer to different objects---meaning a new object was created in step 2---and therefore the object type is immutable.

For example, the following experiment shows that `dict` is a mutable type.
```python
>>> dict_1 = {1: 'x', 2: 'b'`           # Create a dictionary.
>>> dict_2 = dict_1                     # Assign it a new name.
>>> dict_2[1] = 'a'                     # Change the 'new' dictionary.
>>> dict_1 == dict_2                    # Compare the two names.
 True                                   # Both names changed!
```
Print a statement of your conclusions that clearly indicates which object types are mutable and which are immutable.



### Task 9

Create a module called `calculator.py`.
Write a function that returns the sum of two arguments and a function that returns the product of two arguments.
Also use `import` to add the `sqrt()` function from the `math` module to the namespace.
When this file is either run or imported, nothing should be executed.

In your solutions file, import your new custom module.
Write a function that accepts two numbers representing the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
Using only the functions from `calculator.py`, calculate and return the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle.




### Task 10 - Modules

In IPython explore the modules: 
- `itertools`
- `sys`
- `random`
- `time`


### Task 11 - Module Itertools


The \emph{power set} of a set $A$, denoted $\mathcal{P}(A)$ or $2^A$, is the set of all subsets of $A$, including the empty set $\emptyset$ and $A$ itself.
For example, the power set of the set $A = \{a, b, c\}$ is $2^A = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\}\}$.

Write a function that accepts an iterable $A$.
Use an \li{itertools} function to compute the power set of $A$ as a list of sets (why couldn't it be a set of sets in Python?).
% \\(Hint: The power set of a set with $n$ elements should have exactly
$2^n$ elements.)






### Task 12  - Classes


Expand the \li{Backpack} class to match the following specifications.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the constructor so that it accepts three total arguments: \li{name}, \li{color}, and \li{max_size} (in that order).
Make \li{max_size} a keyword argument that defaults to $5$.
Store each input as an attribute.
% Update the \li{Backpack} and \li{Backpack.__init__()} docstrings to document the changes.

\item Modify the \li{put()} method to check that the backpack does not go over capacity.
If there are already \li{max_size} items or more, print ``No Room!'' and do not add the item to the contents list.
% Update the docstring to reflect the change.

\item Write a new method called \li{dump()} that resets the contents of the backpack to an empty list.
This method should not receive any arguments (except \li{self}).
% Write a short docstring for the method.

\item Documentation is especially important in classes so that the user knows what an object's attributes represent and how to use methods appropriately.
Update (or write) the docstrings for the \li{__init__()}, \li{put()}, and \li{dump()} methods, as well as the actual class docstring (under \li{class} but before \li{__init__()}) to reflect the changes from parts 1-3 of this problem.
\end{enumerate}

To ensure that your class works properly, write a test function outside outside of the \li{Backpack} class that instantiates and analyzes a \li{Backpack} object.
\begin{lstlisting}
def test_backpack():
    testpack = Backpack("Barry", "black")       # Instantiate the object.
    if testpack.name != "Barry":                # Test an attribute.
        print("Backpack.name assigned incorrectly")
    for item in ["pencil", "pen", "paper", "computer"]:
        testpack.put(item)                      # Test a method.
    print("Contents:", testpack.contents)
    # ...
\end{lstlisting}


### Task 13 -- Inheritance


Write a \li{Jetpack} class that inherits from the \li{Backpack} class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Override the constructor so that in addition to a name, color, and maximum size, it also accepts an amount of fuel.
Change the default value of \li{max_size} to $2$, and set the default value of fuel to $10$.
Store the fuel as an attribute.

\item Add a \li{fly()} method that accepts an amount of fuel to be burned and decrements the fuel attribute by that amount.
If the user tries to burn more fuel than remains, print ``Not enough fuel!'' and do not decrement the fuel.

\item Override the \li{dump()} method so that both the contents and the fuel tank are emptied. % (set the fuel level to zero).

\item Write clear, detailed docstrings for the class and each of its methods.
\end{enumerate}



### Task 14 -- Magic Methods


Endow the \li{Backpack} class with two additional magic methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \li{__eq__()} magic method is used to determine if two objects are equal, and is invoked by the \li{==} operator.
Implement the \li{__eq__()} magic method for the \li{Backpack} class so that two \li{Backpack} objects are equal if and only if they have the same name, color, and number of contents.

\item The \li{__str__()} magic method returns the string representation of an object.
This method is invoked by \li{str()} and used by \li{print()}.
Implement the \li{__str__()} method in the \li{Backpack} class so that printing a \li{Backpack} object yields the following output (that is, construct and return the following string).
\begin{lstlisting}
<<Owner:      <name>
Color:      <color>
Size:       <number of items in contents>
Max Size:   <max_size>
Contents:   [<item1>, <item2>, ...]>>
\end{lstlisting}
(Hint: Use the tab and newline characters \li{'\\t'} and \li{'\\n'} to align output nicely.)
\end{enumerate}
