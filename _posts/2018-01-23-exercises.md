## Sheet1 

Exercises for Monday, February 5 :


1. a) Write down an LP-formulation of the Vertex Cover problem.

   b) Write down the dual of the LP for Vertex Cover.

   c) Which combinatorial problem does the dual correspond to?

2.  Consider the primal-dual algorithm for Vertex Cover.
    <br>
    What does the algorithm do?
    <br>
    Write down the same algorithm without explicitly using the
    LP-formulation of the problem.

3.  Assume that you have an algorithm for finding a minimum vertex cover
    in a graph. 
    
    a) Explain how you can use the algorithm for finding a
       maximum independent set.

    b) Does this mean that you can use an approximation algorithm for
       Set Cover, like the ones in Sections 1.3 and 1.4,
       for approximating a maximum independent set? 
       <br>
      (Hint: What approximation factor could you obtain?)

4.  Although the vertex cover problem is NP-hard for general graphs,
    there are graph classes that allow for efficient algorithms.

    Design an algorithm that finds an optimal vertex cover for a tree in
    linear time.
