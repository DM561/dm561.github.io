## Sheet 4

### Task 1 - Help on asg 1

In this task you will be receiving help on the implementation of the
sparse vectors and matrices for asg1. Those who have already
succeeded in the implementation can focus on the remaining tasks.


### Task 2

Revise the exercises from Sheet 1 on Python and use the instructor to
clarify your doubts on Python programming. In particular, focus on the
Tasks 17-23 on Numpy. As you should learn from the benchmarks in
Assignment 1, you should always use Numpy to carry out linear algebra
calculations. 


### Task 3 -- Matplotlib: Plotting in Python

Using the results from `benchmark.py` of assignment 1, compare the
growth curve of your implementation and Numpy implementation of matrix
multiplication. Consider only square matrices of varying size. Try to
perform logarithmic transformations on the axis. Which transformation
will lead to a liner growth? What does this says on the growth function
(ie, polynomial or exponential) of the the procedures?
[You will need to modify `benchmark.py` to print out the results for different sizes of the matrices. You should put the results in a file. Then your script for plotting should read the data from the file and plot the growth curves.]
