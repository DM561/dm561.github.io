## Sheet 2


Revise the exercises from Sheet 1 on Python programming and use the
instructor to clarify your doubts on this topic. In particular, focus on
the Tasks 17-23 on Numpy. As you should learn from the benchmarks in
Assignment 1, you should always use Numpy to carry out linear algebra
calculations.
