#### Assignment 0: Only testing

```python
{% include_relative {{ page.script }} %}
```


The sepc file associated with this assignment is `asg0`.

##### Task 1

A built-in data structure in Python are lists.  Implement the function
`squares` that returns a list of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers. Try using list comprehensions.

```python
= [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```


##### Task 2

Implement the function `multiples` that takes as input a number between
1 and 100 and returns all multiples of this number in the range from 0
to 100 (100 included).


##### Task 3

Lists can be used to represent vectors of numbers as in Linear
Algebra. However, as you can test in a python shell, for example,
`ipython`, the effect the operator `+` is not really the expected
one. Your first task is to write a function `sum_lists` that takes two
lists of equal size as inputs and outputs a list of the same size whose
elements are the element-wise sum of the elements of the two inputed
vectors. For example:


```python
> a = [1, 1, 1]
> b = [2, 2, 2]
> sum_lists(a,b)

= [3, 3, 3]
```
