## Sheet 5





### Task 1

Write a function that accepts an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ of rank $n$ and
a vector $\mathbf{b}$ of length $n$.  Use the QR decomposition
<!--
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\nonumber
A^{\mathsf T} A\widehat{\mathbf{x}} &= A^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{b} \\ \nonumber
(Q R)^{\mathsf T} Q R  \widehat{\mathbf{x}}
&= (Q R)^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{b} \\ \nonumber
 R^{\mathsf T} Q^{\mathsf T} Q R  \widehat{\mathbf{x}}
&=  R^{\mathsf T} Q^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{b} \\ \nonumber
 R^{\mathsf T} R \widehat{\mathbf{x}}
&=  R^{\mathsf T} Q^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{b} \\
 R \widehat{\mathbf{x}}
&= Q^{\mathsf T} \mathbf{b}
\end{array}
\]
-->
to solve the normal equations corresponding to $A\mathbf{x} =
\mathbf{b}$.

You may use either SciPy's QR routine or write your own QR routine.
In addition, you may use `la.solve_triangular()`, SciPy's optimized
routine for solving triangular systems. Compare the results of your
function with the hand-computed results on the small example generated
by the data set $\\{(0,1),(2,1),(2,1)\\}$: 
\[ 
A=\begin{bmatrix}
0&1\\
2&1\\
2&1
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad b=\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
1\\
2
\end{bmatrix}
\]



### Task 2


The file [`housing.npy`]({{ "/assets/housing.npy" | absolute_url }})
(Numpy provides methods for saving and loading arrays. This file has
been saved with `np.save()` and the array can be loaded with
`np.load("housing.npy")`) contains the purchase-only housing price
index, a measure of how housing prices are changing, for the
[United States](http://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index.aspx)
from 2000 to 2010. Each row in the array is a separate measurement; the
columns are the year and the price index, in that order.  To avoid large
numerical computations, the year measurements start at 0 instead of
2000.

Find the least squares line that relates the year to the housing price
index (i.e., let year be the $x$-axis and index the $y$-axis).


- Construct the matrix $A$ and the vector $\mathbf{b}$ described in the
    slides. (Hint: `np.vstack()`, `np.column_stack()`, and/or
    `np.ones()` may be helpful.)
- Use your function from the previous task to find the least squares solution.
- Plot the data points as a scatter plot.
- Plot the least squares line with the scatter plot.




### Task 3


The data in [`housing.npy`]({{ "/assets/housing.npy" | absolute_url }}) is nonlinear, and might be better fit by a
polynomial than a line.

Write a function that uses the procedure presented in the slides to
calculate the polynomials of degree $3$, $6$, $9$, and $12$ that best
fit the data.  Plot the original data points and each least squares
polynomial together in individual subplots. (Hint: define a separate,
refined domain with `np.linspace()` and use this domain to smoothly
plot the polynomials.)

Instead of using the procedure developed in Task 1 to solve the normal
equations, you may use SciPy's least squares routine,
`scipy.linalg.lstsq()`.

```Python
>>> from scipy import linalg as la

# Define A and b appropriately. Get help with the `np.vander` function
# for the construction of A

# Solve the normal equations using SciPy's least squares routine.
# The least squares solution is the first of four return values.
>>> x = la.lstsq(A, b)[0]
```

Compare your results to `np.polyfit()`.  This function receives an
array of $x$ values, an array of $y$ values, and an integer for the
polynomial degree, and returns the coefficients of the best fit
polynomial of that degree.

<!--
\begin{comment}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Generate some random data close to the line y = x^2 - 3x + 2.
>>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 20)
>>> y = x**2 - 3*x + 2 + np.random.randn(20)

# Use np.polyfit() to calculate the best fit 2nd degree polynomial.
>>> coeffs = np.polyfit(x, y, 2)

>>> domain = np.linspace(0, 10, 200)
>>> plt.plot(x, y, 'k*')
>>> plt.plot(domain, np.polyval(coeffs, domain))
>>> plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}
-->





### Task 4

The general equation for an ellipse is
\[ax^2 + bx + cxy + dy + ey^2 = 1.\] Write a function that calculates
the parameters for the ellipse that best fits the data in the file
[`ellipse.npy`]({{ "/assets/ellipse.npy" | absolute_url }}).  Plot the
original data points and the ellipse together, using the following
function to plot the ellipse.

```Python
def plot_ellipse(a, b, c, d, e):
    """Plot an ellipse of the form ax^2 + bx + cxy + dy + ey^2 = 1."""
    theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)
    cos_t, sin_t = np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta)
    A = a*(cos_t**2) + c*cos_t*sin_t + e*(sin_t**2)
    B = b*cos_t + d*sin_t
    r = (-B + np.sqrt(B**2 + 4*A)) / (2*A)
    plt.plot(r*cos_t, r*sin_t, lw=2)
    plt.gca().set_aspect("equal", "datalim")
```
