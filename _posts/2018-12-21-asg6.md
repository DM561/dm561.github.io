#### Assignment 6: Eigenfaces

*Submission Deadline: Wednesday, January 9 2018, at noon*


The only script that you have to edit and submit before the deadline is
`asg6-eigenfaces/asg6.py`. We also provide additional scripts and image
files. You get them by pulling your git
repository. For your convenience the file `EigenFace.py` can be used
for visualising faces as the the weightd sum of eigenfaces. Helper functions
needed (e.g., to load files) are provided in `helper.py`. Only
`asg6-eigenfaces/asg6.py`, will be used for grading and testing,
any changes in the other files will not be included (specifically
the `helper.py` will be used not from your repository, but in the
original version that was provided to you. The same holds for the images,
and modification or addition will be ignored for the testing.

More details are given in the repository file `asg6.py`. The automatic
grading will start Dec 21st.
