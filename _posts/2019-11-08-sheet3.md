## Sheet 3

In this class you will receive help on the implementation of the
sparse vectors and sparse matrices for `asg1`. 

You will also work on the following tasks about data visualization.



### Task 1 -- Matplotlib: Plotting in Python

Using the results from `benchmark.py` of assignment 1, compare the
growth curve of your implementation and Numpy implementation of matrix
multiplication. Consider only square matrices of varying size. Try to
perform logarithmic transformations on the axis. Which transformation
will lead to a liner growth? What do the plots say about the growth function
(ie, polynomial or exponential) of the procedures?
[You will need to modify `benchmark.py` to print out the results for different sizes of the matrices. You should put the results in a file. Then your script for plotting should read the data from the file and plot the growth curves.]
