#### Assignment 3: Wiener Index and Polygons

*Submission Deadline: Friday, December 7 2018, at noon*


The scripts that you have to edit and submit before the deadline are
`asg3-wienerpolygon/wiener.py` and
`asg3-wienerpolygon/polygon.py`. You get them by pulling your git
repository. For your convenience we also provide a file for
visualization of the animated polygon
`asg3-wienerpolygon/linalg-ellipse.py`, which will not be used
for grading and testing.

Start with working on `asg3-wienerpolygon/polygon.py` as a correct
implementation will allow you to get 92 of the 100 possible points.
The remaining 8 points can be achieved by a correct implementation of
`asg3-wienerpolygon/wiener.py`.
