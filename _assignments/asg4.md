#### Assignment 4: From Random Polygon to Ellipse / Wiener Index 

*Submission Deadline: Thursday, December 2 2021, at noon*


The scripts that you have to edit and submit before the deadline are
`asg4-wienerpolygon/wiener.py` and
`asg4-wienerpolygon/polygon.py`. You find the latter also imported it below.

```
