Dear All,

from week 45 we start the second part of "Linear Algebra with
Applications", which will be taught by Daniel Merkle and Marco
Chiarandini.

The goal of this part of the course is learning to carry out the linear
algebra calculations that you have been discussiing so far in the
scientific computing enviroment of Python. After the first week where
there will be a review of the syntax of the Python programming language
we will work with the Linear Algebra computations of a few
applications. We that you will enjoy this part and learn a lot!


For this part of the course the main webpage becomes:

    https://dm561.github.io/

That will be the place where we will post relevant material for this
course: updated schedule, slides, lecture notes, links, etc. Please,
take a look at the page.

The page is also linked from the left menu in the BlackBoard system. The
BlackBoard system will be used from now on only to post announcements
like this one.





See you on Monday, November 5, at 8:15.
We look forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,
Marco



There you can find the recommended
book for the Linear Algebra part (a PDF version can be found on the
Web).
