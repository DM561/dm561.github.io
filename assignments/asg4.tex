%\subsection*{Task 1}

In the Introduction to Python - Part 3, on slide 9, we compared three
important models for growth functions in computer science applications:

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{exponential model}&$y=ae^{bx}$\\
    \textbf{power function model}&$y=ax^b$\\
    \textbf{logarithmic model}&$y=a+b\ln x$
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

where $a$ and $b$ are to be determined to fit experimental data as
closely as possible. In this exercise you will work with a procedure
called \emph{linearization}, by which the data are transformed to a form
in which a least squares straight line fit can be used to approximate
the constants. Some calculus is required to carry out the task.


Let $x$ denote the different size of two square matrices that we
multiply with each other and $y$ the computation time registered by
executing, for example, the script benchmark from Assignment 1.

We will assume to have collected the following data (also available in
the associated python script:

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|*{9}{c}}
    x&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9\\
    y&1.75&1.91&2.03&2.13&2.22&2.30&2.37&2.43
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
    
We will fit a linear model and the three models above using least
squares and decide which is the best model.



\paragraph{Linear function} Implement the function
\lstinline{least_squares(A,b)} that takes an appropriate matrix $A$ and
vector $\vec b$ and returns the least square solution $\vec z$ of the
system $A\vec z=\vec b$. In the implementation, you are not allowed to
use the Numpy and Scipy function \lstinline{linalg.lstsq(A,b)}.
Using the function \lstinline{least_squares(A,b)} determine the linear
function $y=ax + b$ that best fit the given data $(x_j,y_j)$.


\paragraph{Exponential function}
Making the substitution \[Y=\ln y\] in the equation $y=ae^x$ produces the
equation $Y=bx+\ln a$, whose graph in the $xY$-plane is a line of slope
$b$ and $Y$-intercept $\ln a$.  Verify this fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=ae^x$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_j,y_j)$ by letting $Y_j=\ln y_j$, then fitting a straight
line to the transformed data points $(x_j,Y_j)$ by least squares to find
$b$ and $\ln a$, and then computing $a$ from $\ln a$.  Implement this
method to fit an exponential model in the function
\lstinline{exponential_fit} that uses your
\lstinline{linalg.lstsq(A,b)}. (You may need to use the functions
\lstinline{np.log} and \lstinline{np.exp} for computing the natural
logarithm). You can visualize the situation executing the file
\lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement to draw a
plot with the points and the fitted exponential curve.

\paragraph{Power function}
Making the substitutions \[X=\ln x\qquad \qquad Y=\ln y\] in the
equation $y=ax^b$ produces the equation $Y=bX+\ln a$, whose graph in the
$XY$-plane is a line of slope $b$ and $Y$-intercept $\ln a$. Verify this
fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=ae^x$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_j,y_j)$ by letting $X_j=\ln x_j$ and $Y_j=\ln y_j$, then
fitting a straight line to the transformed data points $(X_j,Y_j)$ by
least squares to find $b$ and $\ln a$, and then computing $a$ from $\ln
a$.  Implement this method to fit an power model in the function
\lstinline{power_fit}. You can visualize the situation executing the
file \lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement to
draw a plot with the points and the fitted curve.


\paragraph{Logarithmic function} Making the substitution \[X=\ln x\]
in the equation $y=a+b\ln x^b$ produces the equation $Y=a+bX$, whose
graph in the $Xy$-plane is a line of slope $b$ and $y$-intercept
$a$. Verify this fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=a+b\ln x$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_j,y_j)$ by letting $X_j=\ln x_j$, then fitting a straight
line to the transformed data points $(X_j,y_j)$ by least squares to find
$b$ and $a$, and then computing $a$ from $\ln a$.  Implement this
method to fit a logarithmic model in the function
\lstinline{logarithmic_fit}. You can visualize the situation executing
the file \lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement
to draw a plot with the points and the fitted curve.


\paragraph{Training error} Implement the function
\lstinline{training_error(f,x,y)} that returns the \color{red}
{\bf root}\color{black}\ sum of squared
  errors for the model \lstinline{f}. Using this function compare the
  training error of the four models and determine which model has the
  best training error.

\exercise{}{}

  In the city of Odense, there is a network of bicycle rental stations,
  where you can borrow a city bike for free with your mobile
  phone. The stations are spread over the city and provide a convenient way
  to get around. Bike rental data is made public in an anonymized form
  and it can been analyzed in various ways.

  The task we want to solve is to predict for a given time and day how
  many people will rent a bike in front of the train station --- so that
  you know if any bikes will be left for you when you have to cycle to
  the SDU Campus.

  We look at the data for August 2015 at this particular station. We
  resample the data into 3 hour intervals to obtain the main trends for
  each day. Below is a visualization of the rental frequencies for the
  whole month:

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/bike_aug2015}
  \end{center}

  Looking at the data, we can clearly distinguish day and night for each
  day. The patterns for week days and weekends also seem to be quite
  different.  

%  When evaluating a prediction task on a time series like
%  this, we usually want to learn from the past and predict for the
%  future. This means when doing a split into a training
%  and a test set, we want to use all the data up to a certain date as
%  training set, and all the data past that date as a test set. This is
%  how we would usually use time series pre‚Äê diction: given everything
%  that we know about rentals in the past, what do we think will happen
%  tomorrow?  

  In all we have 248 data points. 
  We use the first 184 data points, corresponding to the
  first 23 days, as our training set, and the remaining 64 data points
  corresponding to the remaining 8 days as our test set.

  Two factors seem to be very important: the time of day and the day of
  the week, when a particular number of rentals occurred. So the input
  features are the time of the day: $x_1=\{0,3,6,9,...,21\}$ and the day
  of the week: $x_2=\{0,1,2,\ldots,6\}$ (where $0$ corresponds to Monday
  and so forth) and the output $y$ is the number of rentals in the
  following three hours, which we can assume to be a real number that
  can be rounded to an integer afterwards.

  We consider two linear regression models:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  {\cal H}_1: &&h_1(\vec\theta,\vec x)=\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2\\
  {\cal H}_2: &&h_2(\vec\theta,\vec x)=\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2+\theta_3 x_1x_2 + \theta_4 x_1^2+\theta_5x_2^2
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Fitting the two models yields the two functions $g_1\in {\cal H}_1$ and
  $g_2\in {\cal H}_2$ defined by the following parameters:
\[
\begin{array}{l|r|r|r|r|r|r}
&\theta_0&\theta_1&\theta_2 &\theta_3 & \theta_4 &\theta_5\\
\hline
g_1&5.36&1.26& 0.71&&&\\
g_2&-3.11& 1.29& 3.85& 0.07&-0.12& -0.16\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The predictions of the two models are visualized in the plots below:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/h1}\\
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/h2}
\end{center}

The evaluation of the two models yields the following scores:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|rr}
&$g_1$&$g_2$\\
\hline
Training-set mean squared error:& 154.87&110.49\\
Test-set mean squared error: & 151.27&86.66\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

How many bike rentals would have been predicted for Monday 31st August 2015 from
9 to 12 by the model that the analysis above indicated to be the best?
