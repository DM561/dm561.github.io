%\subsection*{Task 1}

In the Introduction to Python - Part 3, on slide 12, we compared three
important models for growth functions in computer science applications:

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{exponential model}&$y=ae^{bx}$\\
    \textbf{power function model}&$y=ax^b$\\
    \textbf{logarithmic model}&$y=a+b\ln x$
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

where $a$ and $b$ are to be determined to fit experimental data as
closely as possible. In this exercise you will work with a procedure
called \emph{linearization}, by which the data are transformed to a form
in which a least squares straight line fit can be used to approximate
the constants. % Some calculus is required to carry out the task.


Let $x$ denote the different size of two square matrices that we
multiply with each other and $y$ the computation time registered by
executing, for example, the script benchmark from Assignment 1.

We will assume to have collected the following data $D=\{(x_i,y_i)\}$
(also available in the associated python script):

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|*{9}{c}}
    x&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9\\
    y&1.75&1.91&2.03&2.13&2.22&2.30&2.37&2.43
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
    
We will fit a linear model and the three models above using least
squares and decide which is the best model.



\paragraph{Linear function} Implement the function
\lstinline{least_squares(A,b)} that takes an appropriate matrix $A$ and
vector $\vec b$ and returns the least square solution $\vec z$ of the
system $A\vec z=\vec b$. In the implementation, you are not allowed to
use the function function \lstinline{linalg.lstsq(A,b)} from Numpy and
Scipy.  Using the function \lstinline{least_squares(A,b)} determine the
linear function $y=ax + b$ that best fits the given data $(x_i,y_i)$.
You can visualize the situation executing the file \lstinline{draw.py}
that uses the code of the function \lstinline{linear_model(x,y)} that
you implement to draw a plot with the points and the fitted linear
regression.

\paragraph{Exponential function}
Making the substitution \[Y=\ln y\] in the equation $y=ae^{bx}$ produces the
equation $Y=bx+\ln a$, whose graph in the $xY$-plane is a line of slope
$b$ and $Y$-intercept $\ln a$.  Verify this fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=ae^{bx}$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_i,y_i)$ by letting $Y_i=\ln y_i$, then fitting a straight
line to the transformed data points $(x_i,Y_i)$ by least squares to find
$b$ and $\ln a$, and then computing $a$ from $\ln a$.  Implement this
method to fit an exponential model in the function
\lstinline{exponential_fit} that uses your
\lstinline{least_squares(A,b)}. (You may need to use the functions
\lstinline{np.log} and \lstinline{np.exp} for computing the natural
logarithm). You can visualize the situation executing the file
\lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement to draw a
plot with the points and the fitted exponential curve.

\paragraph{Power function}
Making the substitutions \[X=\ln x\qquad \qquad Y=\ln y\] in the
equation $y=ax^b$ produces the equation $Y=bX+\ln a$, whose graph in the
$XY$-plane is a line of slope $b$ and $Y$-intercept $\ln a$.  Verify
this fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=ax^b$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_i,y_i)$ by letting $X_i=\ln x_i$ and $Y_i=\ln y_i$, then
fitting a straight line to the transformed data points $(X_i,Y_i)$ by
least squares to find $b$ and $\ln a$, and finally computing $a$ from $\ln
a$.  Implement this method to fit an power model in the function
\lstinline{power_fit}. You can visualize the situation executing the
file \lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement to
draw a plot with the points and the fitted curve.


\paragraph{Logarithmic function} Making the substitution \[X=\ln x\]
in the equation $y=a+b\ln x$ produces the equation $Y=a+bX$, whose
graph in the $Xy$-plane is a line of slope $b$ and $y$-intercept
$a$. Verify this fact!

Hence, a curve of the form $y=a+b\ln x$ can be fitted to the given $n$ data
points $(x_i,y_i)$ by letting $X_i=\ln x_i$ and then fitting a straight
line to the transformed data points $(X_i,y_i)$ by least squares to find
$b$ and $a$.  Implement this
method to fit a logarithmic model in the function
\lstinline{logarithmic_fit}. You can visualize the situation executing
the file \lstinline{draw.py} that uses the function that you implement
to draw a plot with the points and the fitted curve.


\paragraph{Training error} Implement the function
\lstinline{training_error(f,x,y)} that returns the \color{red}
{\bf root}\color{black}\ sum of squared
  errors for the model \lstinline{f}. Using this function compare the
  training error of the four models and determine which model has the
  best training error.
